# BardsTale1CharEdit
Yet another Character Editor for Bard's Tale 1: Tales of the Unknown  DOS Version.

Wrote this late one night, because the first few I tried didn't do what I wanted.  Mostly I just wanted a Button to push that healed the party.  Some other stuff evolved because I wanted to know how much damage a weapon did.

Has not had a lot of testing.  A lot of edge cases have not been worked out.  E.G. like exactly how long is the char name, what should the limit be for experiece, etc.

To use you need to enter your BARD folder in the config file or the first textbox.  The config file also has an entry for a Backup folder, where it saves copies of the files before it overwrites the data.
